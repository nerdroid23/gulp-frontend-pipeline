# SCSS

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it. If you delete it remember to remove all references to the `cssTask` task from `./gulpfile.js`**

This directory contains your un-compiled and un-minified sass files.

The most important file in this directory is `main.scss` and it is necessary. **The sass files will not compile if it doesn't exist.**
