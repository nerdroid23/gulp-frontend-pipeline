# JS LIBS

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it. If you delete it remember to remove all references to the `jsTask` task from `./gulpfile.js`**

This directory contains the javascript libraries that you will use in the project (i.e. jquery, bootstrap.js, ect).

The most important file in this directory is `main.js` and it is necessary. **The js files will not compile if it doesn't exist.**
